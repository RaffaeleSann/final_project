    "In this notebook we want to write a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the aim of classify the images taken by the **CIFAR-10** dataset. Moreover we want to use **Particle Swarm Optimization** (PSO) in order to optimize some characteristics of the CNN concerning architecture and hyperparameters. The PSO has been implemented by us as a class called *INSERIRE NOME CLASSE"

Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.\n",
